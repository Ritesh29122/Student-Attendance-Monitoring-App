# Attendance Monitoring App using Bluetooth 

Using Android Studio, the Android application was developed with a focus on functionality for attendance marking.
Bluetooth functionality was seamlessly integrated to facilitate communication between the teacher's device and student's devices, with a specific emphasis on identifying nearby devices
A robust attendance marking algorithm was implemented to ensure accuracy, prevent duplicate entries, and accommodate potential disruptions in Bluetooth connectivity.
Simultaneously, Firebase integration was realized by setting up a Firebase project, configuring the app to connect to the Firebase Realtime Database.
Test the app frequently across various Android versions and devices to make sure it works and to catch any possible problems.
